    "## Path-finding in hexagonal grids \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on material from Chapter 3 Solving Problems by Searching. You will need to review that material on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on hexagonal grids \n",
    "https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/\n",
    "Many computer games use hexagonal grids. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe how path finding from a particular hexagonal grid location A to another hexagonal grid location B can be expressed as a search problem. Be precise about the formulation and use the one of the coordinate systems described above in order to illustrate this formulation with a particular example. **(Basic - 2 points)**\n",
    "2. Assume that some hexagonal locations contain an obstacles. \n",
    "Show how you can calculate a \"distance\" between two hexagonal locations and describe how it could be used as a heuristic for informed search strategies for the path finding problem with obstacles **(Basic - 2 points)** \n",
    "3. Write code that given two hexagonal grid coordinates finds a path that connects them using uninformed search strategies **(Expected - 2 points)**\n",
    "4. Write code that given two cells in a hexagonal grid expressed by their corresponding grid coordinates and a list of obstacles (expressed by their corresponding grid coordinates) finds a path that connects them and avoids obstacles using greedy and A\\*-search. Use an appropriately defined distance on the hexagonal grid for guiding the A\\* search **(Expected - 2 points)**. \n",
    "5. Write code that draws a hexagon grid with two locations and obstacles and displays the path found. Use your visualization to illustrate how different search algorithms operate. **(Advanced - 2 points)** \n",

    "### 1. To express such a problem as a search problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "I will consider a hexagonal grid with 9 hexagons, arranged using an \"odd-r\" horizontal layout. The first number is the column number, and the second number is the row number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set of states / State Space:** Since search problems deal with atomic representations of the world, the set of states is the set of all grid coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images\\hex-grid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial State:** The grid coordinates of the starting location A. Ex: (0, 0)\n",
    "![](images\\AB-hex-grid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal State:** The grid coordinates of the goal location B. Ex: (1, 1)\n",
    "![](images\\AB-hex-grid-goal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions set:** At a certain grid location, the set of 6 or less actions corresponding to moving to each neighbouring hex location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transition model:** The function describing the resulting hex coordinate when taking each action. In the initial state above, the only available moves are \"Right\" or \"Down-Right\", which results in (1,0) or (0,1), respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Action cost:** The cost of each movement is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructed in this way, we can then simulate paths by selecting moves in each state, and select the shortest path (the path with the least total action cost). \n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Calculating a \"distance\" between two hexagonal locations:\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a distance between two hexagonal locations, (a, b) and (c, d):\n",
    "\n",
    "distance = | a - c | + | b - d |\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this distance formula, we can select the best node in the frontier to expand next, by calculating the distance from each node in the frontier to the goal and selecting the shortest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Code for uninformed search\n",
    "\n",
    "Using code from the aima repository, for this question I wrote a subclass of the Problem class called HexProblem. The \"graph\" passed to the Problem is a collection of coordinates in a hexgrid. For the actions, I appended different coordinate translations (depending on whether the current coordinate's row was even or odd) and then removed the impossible moves (at the edges of the grid). Since the action moves are encoded as the next states themselves, the result function simply returns the \"action\" as the new state if it is a viable move.\n",
    "Once a solution is found, the path is traced back from the goal node, and the initial state is prepended to the path for ease of drawing."
